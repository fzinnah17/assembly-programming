# x86 Emulator and Game of 23

## 1. x86 Emulator

Designed and developed for an Assembly Programming course, this emulator mimics the functionality of an x86 processor. It runs simple assembly code in binary format, offering features like direct output, debugging interface, and execution statistics.

### Key Features

- Emulates x86 architecture and executes binary (.com) files.
- Debugging capabilities with step-by-step execution.
- Output functions and register content display.
- Execution statistics and support for extended commands.

### Technical Aspects

- Written in C language.
- Implements memory management and register emulation.
- Capable of handling various binary executable formats.


## 2. Game of 23

An implementation of the traditional puzzle game, Game of 23. This project challenges players to arrange numbered tiles in order using a grid system.

### Gameplay

- Based on the classic Game of Fifteen puzzles.
- Players move tiles within a grid to achieve a specific order.
- Supports various grid sizes, including a 4x6 layout with 23 pieces.

### Development

- Focuses on logic and algorithmic problem-solving.
- Includes a user-friendly interface for interactive gameplay.
- Enhancements include advanced tile movement and grid resizing capabilities.

These projects demonstrate a blend of low-level programming skills and logical problem-solving, showcasing the versatility of assembly language in both emulation and game development.
